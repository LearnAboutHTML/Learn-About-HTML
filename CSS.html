<h1>What is CSS?</h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets are known as CSS. On screens, in print, or in other media, CSS specifies how HTML components should be rendered. Work is greatly reduced using CSS. It may simultaneously control the design of several web pages. CSS files contain external stylesheets.</p><br><br>
<h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
<p>A selector, a property, and its value are the components of a CSS Syntax rule. The HTML element where CSS style is to be applied is indicated by the selector. Semicolons are used to separate each CSS property. The property: value pair that is specified for the particular selector is combined with the selection name.</p><br>
<h3>How to add CSS</h3>
<p>A browser will format an HTML document in accordance with the information in a style sheet when it reads one.<br><br>
 <mark>Three Ways to Insert CSS:</mark><br><br>
<mark>1.External CSS</mark><br>
-By modifying only one file in an external style sheet, you can alter the appearance of a complete website!<br>
-Each HTML page must provide a link to the external style sheet file in the head section's link> element.<br><br>
<mark>2. Internal CSS</mark><br>
-If only one HTML page has a distinct style, an internal style sheet might be employed.<br>
-The internal style is specified in the head section's style> element.<br><br>
<mark>3. Inline CSS</mark><br>
-To apply a special style to just one element, use an inline style.<br>
-Add the style attribute to the appropriate element to apply inline styles. Any CSS property may be contained in the style attribute.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Comment</h3>
<p>Simply enclose your ordinary text in /* */ marks to comment in CSS. Indicating that they are notes and shouldn't be presented on the front end, this informs the browser. They can be formatted as multi-line comments as well.</p><br>
<h3>CSS color</h3>
<p>The currentcolor value is set as well as the foreground color value for an element's text and text decorations using the color CSS attribute. Currentcolor is the default value for other color properties like border-color and can be used as an indirect value on other properties.<br><br>
<mark>Predefined color names or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, and HSLA values are used to specify colors.</mark><br><br>
<mark>1.Color names</mark><br>
-A predetermined color name can be used in CSS to specify a color.<br><br>
<mark>2. Color Values</mark><br>
-Additionally, RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, and HSLA values can be used in CSS to specify colors.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Background</h3>
<p>The initial position of the background-image for an element is defined by the CSS background attribute. For specifying the <b>background-color, background-image, background-repeat, background-attachment,</b> and <b>background-position</b> CSS properties, this shorthand property is used.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Border</h3>
<p>An element's border can be set using the shortcut property border in CSS. The size, style, and color of an element's border can all be customized using the CSS border properties.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Margin and Padding</h3>
<p>In CSS, padding is the area between an element's border and its content, whereas a margin is the area surrounding an element's border. To put it another way, the padding property controls the interior space of an element, and the margin property controls the area around it.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Height and Width</h3>
<p>The height and width of an element are set using the height and width properties. Padding, borders, and margins are not included in the height and width values. It determines the padding, border, and margin of the element's padding and width.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Fonts</h3>
<p>The CSS Fonts module describes the attributes of fonts and how font resources are loaded. It enables you to choose a font's style, including the family, size, and weight of the font, the height of the lines, and the glyph variants to use when there are several available for a single character.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Icons</h3>
<p>The graphics or symbols used in any computer interface to represent an element are known as icons. It is a graphical depiction of a program or file that enables the user to easily determine the type of file. To add icons to our HTML page, the simplest method is to use the icon library.</p><br>
<h3>CSS links</h3>
<p>A link is a connection that connects two websites. Links can be styled in a variety of ways using CSS properties. States of Link: Understanding a link's states is essential before talking about CSS characteristics. Links can be styled using pseudo classes and can exist in many states.</p><br>
<h3>CSS lists</h3>
<p>You can set several list item markers for ordered lists using the CSS list properties. For unordered lists, use various list item markers. Mark each list item with an image. Lists and list items can have colored backgrounds.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Display</h3>
<p>The display CSS property controls the layout for an element's children, such as flow layout, grid, or flex, as well as whether it is handled as a block or inline element. The display attribute formally determines the inner and outer display kinds for an element.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Max-Width</h3>
<p>The max-width CSS attribute controls an element's maximum width. It stops the used value of the width property from increasing above the max-width value.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Position Property</h3>
<p>-The type of positioning mechanism utilized for an element is specified by the position attribute.<br><br>
-Then, using the top, bottom, left, and right properties, elements are positioned. But until the position property is set first, these properties won't function. Additionally, depending on the position value, they operate differently.<br><br>
<mark>There are five different position values:</mark><br><br>
<mark>1.Static</mark><br>
-By default, HTML elements are static in location.<br>
-The top, bottom, left, and right attributes have no effect on items that are static in their positions.<br>
-An element with the positioning attribute static is always positioned in accordance with the natural flow of the page and does not require any additional positioning.<br><br>
<mark>2. Relative</mark><br>
-A component with the positioning attribute relative is positioned in relation to its default location.<br>
-A comparably positioned element will be moved from its default position if the top, right, bottom, and left properties are changed. Other content won't be changed to fill in any gaps the element could leave.<br><br>
<mark>3.Fixed</mark><br>
-Positioned relative to the viewport, an element with the attribute position: fixed; always remains in the same location regardless of how far the page is scrolled. The element's position can be adjusted using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.<br>
-When an element is fixed, its original place on the page is not left blank.<br><br>
<mark>4. Absolute</mark><br>
-An element with the position attribute is placed in relation to its closest ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).<br>
-The document body is used and the element scrolls with the page if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors.<br><br>
<mark>Note:</mark> Items with absolute positioning are not part of the usual flow and may overlap.<br><br>
<mark>5. Sticky</mark><br>
-Based on the user's scroll position, an element with the property position: sticky is placed.<br>
-According on the scroll position, a sticky element can be fixed or relative. It is at a relative position until a predetermined offset position is reached in the viewport, at which point it "sticks" there (like position:fixed).</p><br>
<h3>CSS Z-index</h3>
<p>The stack order of an element is specified by the z-index property. A higher stack order element is always in front of a lower stack order element.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Float</h3>
<p>Text and inline elements can wrap around an element that is placed on the left or right side of its container using the float CSS property. The element is nevertheless included in the flow of the page even though it is not part of the regular flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).</p><br>
<h3>CSS Inline-block</h3>
<p>The "display: inline-block" property is used to display an element as a block container at the inline level. The element can apply height and width values even when it is represented as an inline element. As an inline element, it is used (on the same line as adjacent content).</p><br>
<h3>CSS Align</h3>
<p>The spacing between and around content elements along a flexbox's cross-axis or a grid's block axis is determined by the CSS align-content property. Grid Layout is used in the interactive example below to show some of the values of this attribute.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Forms</h3>
<p>Users can design interactive forms using CSS form, which offers numerous methods to customize the style. HTML forms can be created and styled using a variety of CSS properties to increase their interactivity.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Gradients </h3>
<p>Gradients are image data type CSS components that depict a change in color between two or more hues. These changes are depicted as either linear or radial transitions. Gradients can be used anywhere an image might be because they are of the image data type. Gradients are most frequently used as backgrounds for elements.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Shadows</h3>
<p>An element's frame can have shadow effects added with the box-shadow CSS attribute. Multiple effects can be selected and separated by commas. The X and Y offsets in relation to the element, the blur and spread radii, as well as the color, all describe a box shadow.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Buttons</h3>
<p>Developers can style HTML buttons to match their website designs using CSS buttons. When buttons change states, you can adjust the colors, text sizes, padding, and even stylistic properties.</p><br>
